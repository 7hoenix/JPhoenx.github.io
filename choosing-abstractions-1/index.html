    <p>You’ve probably heard that one of the hardest things in programming is naming things.</p>

<p>I never really understood exactly what that meant until working on my <a href="http://github.com/JPHoenx/javaServer">Java Server</a>
project at <a href="https://www.8thlight.com">8th Light</a>.</p>

<h3 id="things-are-hard-to-name-for-the-following-reasons">Things are hard to name for the following reasons:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>If you commit to a design then it will be much harder to change from that
design going forwards (you will be battling against technical momentum).</li>
  <li>Naming a thing is where you decide the level of abstraction that it is going
to be at… and choosing a layer of abstraction level… is extremely difficult.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first one is more of a business decision. i.e. will we want to take the time
to refactor this poor design to something better later?</p>

<p>The second one though is a skill set that can be learned.</p>

<p>My mentor <a href="https://twitter.com/pratt_b">Brian Pratt</a> did an excellent Zagaku on
choosing different layers of abstraction for a coffee pot.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to view it as specific objects with behavior… button here… light there…
repository that is either full or empty… etc.</p>

<h3 id="instead-flip-your-thinking-to-work-with-the-underlying-use-case-takes-practice">Instead flip your thinking to work with the underlying use case (takes practice).</h3>

<p>So for my Server project. The one main thing I’m allowed to use is the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/Socket.html">Socket class</a>.</p>

<p>Well when I first saw that… I obviously had several questions…</p>

<ul>
  <li>What exactly is a socket (besides perhaps a way for Oracle to ensure its devs keep job security)?</li>
  <li>How do I use it?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="source-code-backwards-approach">Source code backwards approach</h3>

<p>So my first instinct (since I was handed this Socket thing) was to go look at what it
can do and figure out how to use it</p>

<p>Reading the Java docs wasn’t really much help as its description is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A socket is an endpoint for communication between two machines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Thanks Oracle.</strong></p>

<p>I tried working with it and wrapping it in an interface as per Brian’s suggestions.</p>

<p>This is what I ended up with (The test that finally broke me):</p>

<p><strong>NOTE =&gt; If you are reading this blog post looking for code to try… this is not the code for you.
You will end up hating yourself down the road.</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-Java">public void testItSendsBackTheProperResponse() throws Exception {
    String request = "GET / HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: Cake\nAccept-Language: en-us\n";
    String expectedResponse = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nUser-Agent: ServerCake\nContent-Type: text/html\n\n" +
            "&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello world&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;";
    InputStream input = new ByteArrayInputStream(request.getBytes());
    ByteArrayOutputStream output = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    FakeSocket socket = new FakeSocket(input, output);
    FakeServerSocket serverSocket = new FakeServerSocket(socket);
    Server server = new Server(serverSocket);

    server.run();

    String response = output.toString();

    assertEquals(expectedResponse, response);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In short:
I’m trying to inject both input and output streams into the socket which then
gets injected into the serversocket which then gets injected into the server.</p>

<p>Run the server… and then somehow assert that the output stream has a response pushed onto it.</p>

<p><strong>TRIPLEJECTION</strong></p>

<p>This code is dense and confusing and implies that I’m missing a layer of abstraction somewhere.</p>

<p>I was talking to my other mentor <a href="https://twitter.com/radicalzephyr">Geoff Shannon</a> and he recommended
that I should go and try to TDD my SocketWrapper (super creative name) interface.</p>

<h3 id="use-case-approach">Use case approach.</h3>

<p>So what are we wrapping?</p>

<p>Communication between a network (or a client of the network) and the web server.</p>

<p>The network (I think of this as the internet itself) is what we are wrapping.</p>

<p>In order for anything to get in to our web server… it needs to conform
to a few rules that we get to pick.</p>

<p>The general process needs to look like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Network calls into the server with a request.</li>
  <li>The server accepts the request.</li>
  <li>Handles the request.</li>
  <li>And then returns a response.</li>
</ul>

<p>Build a mock client (which is a potential client of the network)…
And the client will send requests to the server.</p>

<p>What are the basic commands we are going to receive?
1) Hey gimme a webpage to me please (has to ask nice).
2) … Other things (remember don’t do free work).</p>

<p>Server =&gt; first check that the request is legit.</p>

<p>Send it to the router for that.</p>

<p>HttpProtocol demands that you conform to it.</p>

<p>It’s an interface that needs the following:
Date, version, request method, headers (optional), body (optional).</p>

<p>Break down the incoming request based on a set of rules…</p>

<p>Look for newlines at first… And then look for double new lines (and then the next thing is the body).</p>

<p>Router can figure out what handling function to call… And then call it.</p>
