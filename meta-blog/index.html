    <ul>
  <li>You need:
    <ul>
      <li>Github account (you can sign up for one <a href="https://www.github.com">here</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>First things first. How do you go about making a blog.</p>

<h2>At a high level in order to make a blog you need 3 things in order to be
successful:</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Consistency</strong>
(choose a schedule and stick to it). Hate schedules? Yeah… I’m in a similar boat.
So instead you can opt for house of cards style. Just post a batch whenever you feel like it and then
alert your audience via the ones that have opted in. And also self promote over social media.</li>
  <li><strong>Pick a topic(s) that you want to focus on.</strong>
Who’s your audience? Many people think that they don’t
want to pigeon hole themselves into a smaller category (I CAN JUST APPEAL TO EVERYONE)… but this
actually has an inverse effect. By trying to appeal to everyone you end up appealing to no one.
Polarizing is what you are going for. And in order to polarize that means that you need to make some
decisions about what you want to blog about.</li>
  <li>Actually <strong>get setup</strong> with the technical side.
I’m going to use Jekyll as its free and super easy.</li>
</ol>

<h2> Step 1 =&gt; Pick a schedule.  </h2>

<p>I’m going to opt for the House of Cards style approach as I don’t like being forced into a habit
structure I haven’t chosen to adopt. I will remain flexible here though and if I find myself not working
hard enough I may have to change to a differen schedule.</p>

<p>Check.</p>

<h2> Step 2 =&gt; Pick a topic(s) to focus on.  </h2>

<ul>
  <li>Mastery Acquisition (my biggest passion).</li>
  <li>Code quality, patterns, principles</li>
  <li>Workflow.</li>
  <li>Escaping the 9 - 5 (I think I’ve done it although I am still working a 9 - 5).
=&gt; I’ll leave this open… but I think that this is a great place to start.</li>
</ul>

<p>Check.</p>

<h2> Step 3 =&gt; Build the thing (the rest of this post is dedicated to that).  </h2>

<p>NOTE: I’m also going to walk you through the specific workflow things that I do (including keystrokes).</p>

<h3> Go to Chrome (or a different browser if you are a pleb).  </h3>

<p>If Chrome is open I would <code class="highlighter-rouge">command - tab</code> over and then hit <code class="highlighter-rouge">command - t</code> to open a new tab where I can search.</p>

<p>If Chrome is not open =&gt; I use a plugin called <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> and have it bound to <code class="highlighter-rouge">option - spacebar</code>.</p>

<p>So from anywhere I would hit <code class="highlighter-rouge">option - spacebar</code> then start typing chrome =&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">ch</code> and then <code class="highlighter-rouge">enter</code>.</p>

<p>Since Chrome pops you right into the search bar I can now type <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code></a>. It should be the first link.</p>

<h3> Go to Jekyll homepage </h3>

<p>Looks like they have pretty decent documentation… so I’m going to follow that and put any gotchas here in this post.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>gem install jekyll</code></pre></figure>

<p>NOTE: The dollar sign means you are typing this in your terminal… don’t actually type it. I use <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/meta-blog/meta-blog-1.jpg" alt="First Error" /></p>

<h3> BOOM... first error message. Was not expecting it to happen so soon.  </h3>

<p>My initial thought after just reading the error message =&gt; I’m doing this on my work computer and I haven’t set up Ruby on it yet… so maybe thats the issue.
Also… I know that Ruby is up to version like 2.3.X or something like that… and this error message is saying I only have 2.0.0 so that could also have something to do with it.</p>

<p>Back to chrome we go.</p>

<p>To debug this I actually typed:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">you don't have wri</code></p>

<p>and the rest of the error message populated itself… so I then typed:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">caps lock - f</code></p>

<p>to populate the search.</p>

<h3> NOTE: Caps lock is bound to ctrl because #winning </h3>

<p>Also worth noting… I use a chrome extension called <a href="https://vimium.github.io/">Vimium</a>
so that I can surf the internet without touching my mouse.</p>

<p>OK… so it looks like my intuition was correct after reading the very first
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14607193/installing-gem-or-updating-rubygems-fails-with-permissions-error">stack overflow</a> response.
Mac OS X ships with Ruby 2.0.0… but that’s just basic Ruby and not anything that
I’ve installed.</p>

<h3> Install Ruby </h3>

<p>So before anything else we need to get an updated version of Ruby and for that I’m
going to install <a href="https://rvm.io/rvm/install">RVM</a> to get Ruby (RVM stands for
<em>Ruby Version Manager</em>).</p>

<p>I’m going to follow their install script as I trust RVM as a source.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span><span class="se">\c</span>url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rvm/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer | bash -s stable</code></pre></figure>

<p>I then had to update my current shell window (you also could close down your terminal and reopen it) with:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span><span class="nb">source</span> /Users/jphoenix/.rvm/scripts/rvm</code></pre></figure>

<p>As of now the latest version of Ruby is 2.3.1 so I’m going to install that.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>rvm install 2.3.1</code></pre></figure>

<p>Note: Ruby takes a while if you have to install it.</p>

<p>OK its finally done.</p>

<p>I ran a quick</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>ruby -v</code></pre></figure>

<p>which stands for “Ruby version” to make sure that in worked.</p>

<p><strong>ROUND 2:</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>gem install jekyll</code></pre></figure>

<p>It worked this time.</p>

<p>OK… it looks like we are pretty much up and running in terms of basic setup… kudos Jekyll.</p>

<h1> Reading the Jekyll docs </h1>

<p>At this point I wanted to get a basic sense of what Jekyll was before I continued on.</p>

<p>To do that I read through the Basic Usage section (found a few things I’m interested in but nothing actionable yet).</p>

<p>I also tried to read the configuration section but my eyes started glazing over… it seemed more like reference
material anyways so I skipped it and moved on.</p>

<p><strong>TIP:</strong> The biggest thing when browsing documentation for something new is you want to show your mind that
this new thing (language, framework, etc)… is just a thing with some new rules.
And you <em>CAN</em> figure it out.
Also… keep moving. If it doesn’t seem relevant or interesting then skip it and come back to it later. You
don’t need to understand everything right now. Just the basics.</p>

<h2> How Jekyll works (accoring to me): </h2>

<p>We have 3 different types of things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Posts</li>
  <li>Drafts</li>
  <li>Pages</li>
</ul>

<h3> Posts need to have a format that begins with a date (the date posted).
And drafts are just posts that don't have a date yet. </h3>

<p>We can style any of these using something called <em>Front Matter</em> where we can specify stuff like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A specific layout</li>
  <li>The author</li>
  <li>Tags</li>
</ul>

<p>I plan on making layout defaults for both posts and pages, etc.</p>

<h2> Creating Pages </h2>

<p>In order to get a <strong>page</strong> to display you do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In your root directory (folder) you create a new directory for the page you want to make:
    <ul>
      <li>jphoenx/about/</li>
      <li>jphoenx/contact/</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Then in each of those you make a new index.html where you actually put the HTML:
    <ul>
      <li>jphoenx/about/index.html</li>
      <li>jphoenx/contact/index.html</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This will generate the routes:
    <ul>
      <li>https://jphoenx.com/about</li>
      <li>https://jphoenx.com/contact</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Then I can adjust a default layout for pages (which both of those are pages). And I’m off to the races.</p>

<h2> Managing Posts </h2>

<p>I can reference all posts (like my homepage displaying all the recent posts for instance)
using the following syntax (reminds me of ERB):</p>

<p><img src="/images/meta-blog/meta-blog-5.jpg" alt="Index of Posts" /></p>

<p>Nothing crazy going on here. Its just a <strong>for loop</strong> that will create links for all of the sites posts.</p>

<p>The <strong>site</strong> command is given to us.
As well as <strong>page</strong></p>

<p>It can also support <strong>collections</strong> if you specify them (I’ll probably use <strong>skills</strong> eventually but I don’t
need to worry about it for now).</p>

<h3> IT SUPPORTS SASS. That is super cool.  </h3>

<p>Do 2 things to get it setup:</p>

<p>First, at the top of our main.scss file</p>

<p>here =&gt; jphoenx/style.scss</p>

<p>We put two rows of three dashes and then we import the files we want:</p>

<p><img src="/images/meta-blog/meta-blog-6.png" alt="Top of css files" /></p>

<p>Second, we put all of our sass files in a /_sass directory</p>

<p>here =&gt; jphoenx/_sass/_base.scss</p>

<h2> JUST DO IT. </h2>

<p>Ok… so now that I’m feeling comfortable with how Jekyll is working I feel ready to build the blog.</p>

<p>So now its time to pick a theme (unless you are an ace designer… which I am not).</p>

<p>A quick search for <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll themes</code> pulled up a ton of options.</p>

<p>The very first one was my favorite on the page. So lets do that =&gt; <a href="https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/Jekyll-Mono">mono theme</a></p>

<h3> Install a theme </h3>

<p>I went to that github page and clicked the <em>clone or download</em> button and then copied the link.</p>

<p><strong>ONLY DO ONE OF THESE</strong></p>

<p>If you have SSH:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>git clone git@github.com:AkshayAgarwal007/Jekyll-Mono.git blog</code></pre></figure>

<p>If you don’t have SSH:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/Jekyll-Mono.git blog</code></pre></figure>

<p>NOTE: if you don’t have SSH then you will also need to put in your username and password whenever you push something.</p>

<p>Now we rm the origin from that guy and make a new one that points to your github.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>blog</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>git remote rm origin</code></pre></figure>

<p>Now go to github and create a new repo named:</p>

<h3> your-username.github.io </h3>

<p>Now whenever you push up your repo… github will handle hosting it for you.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>git init</code></pre></figure>

<p>=&gt; Create new .git directory in your project.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>git add .</code></pre></figure>

<p>=&gt; Add all changes.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>git commit -m <span class="s2">"Initial commit"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>=&gt; Make a new commit with a message.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username-on-github/your-repo-name-you-just-made.git</code></pre></figure>

<p>=&gt; Add a destination for your repo to point to.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>git push origin master</code></pre></figure>

<p>=&gt; Push the changes up to that repo.</p>

<h2> Its working! </h2>

<p><img src="/images/meta-blog/meta-blog-2.jpg" alt="ITS WORKING!" /></p>

<p>NICE! That was very easy.</p>

<p>Now to actually start making changes to it… I don’t think purple is really my color.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>jekyll serve</code></pre></figure>

<p>=&gt; this command will make a new server that you can get to from your browser at localhost:4000</p>

<p>Error… missing some gems.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>gem install jekyll-sitemap jekyll-feed</code></pre></figure>

<p>Then run serve again.</p>

<p>Now we can look at our changes without having to push them up to github.</p>

<h1> Customization </h1>

<h2> Open up your project in your text editor of choice. </h2>

<p>I use vim (and I have vim aliased to v)</p>

<p>So from within the project directory I would just type</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>v .</code></pre></figure>

<p>to look at everything at once.</p>

<p>First place I went to was to change out that purple background color to blue. Since we are using SASS it was
really easy. I just went to _sass/_variables.scss and changed the $mono-color variable.</p>

<p>Next stop was inside of _config.yml</p>

<p>I changed my name and description and I changed the email and github to be my own.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE =&gt; if you change _config.yml then you need to <code class="highlighter-rouge">ctrl - c</code> your server and restart it.</strong></p>

<p>Trade out the avatar photo for my actual photo (I opened finder and dragged in an image of myself and renamed it to avatar.jpg)</p>

<p>But that looks weird. Because of some weird effect around the photo.</p>

<p>To the chrome console we go =&gt; (right click then inspect element).</p>

<p>It looks like the problem is in <code class="highlighter-rouge">ch-info-front</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">ch-img-1</code> or maybe <code class="highlighter-rouge">ch-info-wrap</code>.</p>

<p>My actual process was to go to the code and comment it out and see what it effects…</p>

<p>With vim this is pretty straight forward. I type <code class="highlighter-rouge">/ch-info</code> (cmd - f in most text editors) to search.</p>

<p>And then I scan through and comment out sections of code.</p>

<p>I use a vim plugin to comment and uncomment quickly =&gt; <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary">vim commentary</a></p>

<p>My actual workflow is:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">shift v</code> =&gt; to highlight a line of code and then</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">shift ]</code> =&gt; to move to the next whitespace</p>

<p>(I hit that movement twice if selecting two paragraphs of text).</p>

<p>And then:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">gc</code> =&gt; which is the plugin command for commenting/uncommenting.</p>

<p>From there I save it and move back to the browser where I would refresh and see how it looks.</p>

<p>Probably a better way, but eventually I found the offending code.</p>

<p>Comment out lines 190 - 205 (two sections in a row that both start with <code class="highlighter-rouge">.ch-info-wrap</code>)</p>

<p>OK. Everything is looking pretty good now.</p>

<p>It’s time to actually post our first blog post.</p>

<h2> First blog post </h2>

<p>Remember, the way that Jekyll works is anything in the <em>Posts</em> directory with the correct time stamp is considered a post.</p>

<p>The format it needs is:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>So for this post.</p>

<p>I’m going to save it as <strong>2016-06-16-meta-blog.md</strong></p>

<p>I move it into the posts directory and BOOM I can now see it on my front page! Woot woot.</p>

<p><img src="/images/meta-blog/meta-blog-3.jpg" alt="first post" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately… this is what the actual post looks like</p>

<p><img src="/images/meta-blog/meta-blog-4.jpg" alt="Gross post" /></p>

<p>Plain HTML is not cutting it.</p>

<p>Remember what we read earlier… we need to throw in a piece of meta data at the top so that Jekyll knows which format
we want to use.</p>

<p>I didn’t give it much thought… I just jumped over to my file structure (I use the <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree">NerdTree plugin</a>).</p>

<p>And I have my tree mapped to <code class="highlighter-rouge">leader tt</code> (and my leader is comma). And then I went to posts and pulled up one of the ones in there.</p>

<p>NICE. Looks like I need to put front matter at the top.</p>

<p>Front matter is =&gt; 3 hyphens… tags (like author, title, layout)… then 3 hyphens.</p>

<p><img src="/images/meta-blog/meta-blog-7.png" alt="Front Matter" /></p>

<h2> Markdown woes </h2>

<p>I’ve been trying to type markdown as I go… but I am definitely not a markdown pro…</p>

<p>So at this stage I started going through the post again and fixing all of my formatting.
I had been using a form of pseudo code as I was writing where I would just type</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">(WIP blah blah)</code></p>

<p>and then I could just search for WIP and make changes.</p>

<p>But now its time to make things look good. I used this =&gt; <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#lists">Markdown Cheatsheet</a></p>

<p>NOTE: If you are using Vim and apostrophes are giving you problems snag the <a href="tpope/vim-markdown">Vim Markdown Plugin</a>.</p>

<h2> Final tweaks </h2>

<p>About and Project pages.</p>

<p>I went in and just removed the content for the about and project pages and replaced it with single sentences.</p>

<p>I will work on those when I get around to it.</p>

<p>I also deleted the post examples that were in there before hand.</p>
