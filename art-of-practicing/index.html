<p>Very few things in this world in terms of mastery acquisition are as important as practicing.</p>

<p>Practicing is the act of going through and putting attention on a problem until it moves from the
difficult to the easy. You are assigning a series of neurons that work together to accomplish
a task and making them work together.</p>

<p>Even as few as 10 repetitions can have a pretty noticeable impact.</p>

<p>The biggest thing that most people don’t do is bring things from the basic where they have to put
constant attention on something to go through the 3 basic processes.</p>

<p>Katrina Owen came in and talked at Turing school one time. If you don’t know Katrina she is the creative
mind behind <a href="http://exercism.io/">Exercism.io</a>.</p>

<p>She was talking about how how High Expertise correlates to cognitive processing management.</p>

<p>She was describing three buckets of expertise in order to learn any particular domain.</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code>            MOST PEOPLE PILE UP IN BUCKET B.

      A -----------------&gt; B ------------------&gt; C

  Can't do        Can do with effort      Can do with little / no effort
</code></pre>
</div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bucket A: Can’t do the activity at all (the thing could literally be written in Chinese).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bucket B: Can do the activity… With effort.
Tasks like these are within your wheel house but it takes a considerable amount of effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bucket C: Mastered reliable / automatic.
This is the dream. You no longer have to think about the domain at all you can just perform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are reading this blog… then its safe to assume that you know how to go from Bucket A to Bucket B…
sure this process can <em>always</em> be optimized… but the real question is:</p>

<h4 class="nav-anchor">
<a id="pattern-recognition" class="anchor" href="#pattern-recognition" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pattern Recognition</h4>

<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Optimal-Performance/dp/B00JE2WEEK">the Art of Learning</a>,
Chess Grandmaster Josh Waitzkin (the kid from that movie Searching for Bobby Fischer) talks
about studies done on Chess Experts (2000-2200 elo) v. Chess Grandmasters (2500+ elo).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you don’t know the Chess world at all… grandmaster is the highest you can get (1,522 total in the world
in 2016).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The study was simple enough: show both of them a Chess position and then track how long it took them to
recreate it on an adjacent board.</p>

<p>Heres where it gets interesting:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code>When they had Chess boards with positions from real games the
Grandmasters would be able to recreate it significantly faster
than the experts, but when the boards were just pieces placed at
random both of them took approximately the same amount of time.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The grandmasters had more patterns chunked than the experts… and when they could use these patterns they could
perform the task faster than the experts.</p>

<p>But when it was just random positions their was no difference between the two.</p>

<h4 class="nav-anchor">
<a id="how-do-you-go-from-bucket-b-to-bucket-c" class="anchor" href="#how-do-you-go-from-bucket-b-to-bucket-c" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do you go from Bucket B to Bucket C?</h4>

<h2 id="how-do-you-go-from-bucket-b-to-bucket-c">
<a id="how-do-you-go-from-bucket-b-to-bucket-c-1" class="anchor" href="#how-do-you-go-from-bucket-b-to-bucket-c-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do you go from Bucket B to Bucket C?</h2>

<p>Short answer: the way to get there is through consistent <em>effective</em> practice.</p>

<p>Katrina also mentioned that the perfect size of a subskill that you should be working towards is 3 (or less) sessions
of 45 - 90 minutes each. If you work on things in those blocks and can practice and acquire the skill in that amount
of time then you are well on your way.</p>

<p><strong>More to come.</strong></p>
